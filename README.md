### Rendering & Parameters

Now you are able to render the light field with "Render LightField" Button. Which in effect renders with the camera at a grid of positions. 

Here are four parameters

- **cols/rows**: the size of the camera grid, how many rows and columns are there in the camera grid. For example, if you want to render a light field of size 5x5, modify both to 5.
- **base x/base y**: the distance between two neighbouring camera position measured in meters (blender's unit)

The results will be generated 

### Tricks

When rendering, press `esc` to interrupt rendering.

When the light field is enabled of a certain camera, there is a rectangle outline associate with the camera shown in the 3D view. The size of the camera bound the range of the camera grid.
